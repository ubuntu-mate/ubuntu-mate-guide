      <application>Ubuntu MATE</application>
      is an operating system -- the core software that runs your computer, similar to Microsoft's Windows, Apple's macOS, and Google's Chrome OS. Ubuntu MATE is a distribution (variation or flavor) of Linux designed for beginners, average, and advanced computer users alike. It is a dependable, capable, and modern computer system that rivals all others in popularity and usage.
    </simpara>
    <simpara>
      If you are new to Ubuntu MATE, or only casually acquainted with Linux-based distributions, it can take very little effort to understand how a Linux operating system compares with other computer systems that you may already be familiar with. You will find that Ubuntu MATE is more similar than different. This documentation is designed to help demystify Ubuntu MATE for new-comers and provide a reference for all users. This guide has several sections, each of which has additional detail. Click on any link to explore a topic that interests you. You can always come back to this page or simply continue to explore and learn about Ubuntu MATE and its applications.

      <title>Modern and Full-Featured</title>
      <simpara>Ubuntu MATE is a free, full-featured, and modern computer operating system, with an attractive and easy to understand user interface. Its update manager keeps both the operating system itself and all of its installed applications updated to the most current, most secure release. The operating system is more secure and better-supported than operating systems that come pre-installed on most home computer hardware today. With modest hardware requirements, Ubuntu MATE is suitable for modern workstations, single board computers and older hardware alike. Ubuntu MATE makes modern computers fast and old computers usable.</simpara>

    <sect2 id="flexible">
      <title>Pre-Configured Yet Flexible</title>
      <simpara>Using Ubuntu MATE provides you with the freedom to run a complete, full-featured operating system, pre-configured with most, if not all, of the applications you will need for your daily computing -- or to change anything about the way it looks, the way it works, or the applications it runs to suit your taste.</simpara>
    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="security">
      <title>Built-In Security</title>
      <simpara>Ubuntu MATE is designed with security in mind. Unlike operating systems that update only once a month, Ubuntu MATE receives updates continuously. The updates include security patches for Ubuntu MATE and all of its components. Security updates for all of its installed applications are also provided on the same schedule. This ensures that you have the latest protection for all of your computer's software -- as soon as it's available!</simpara>

      Once you become aware that there is dependable, secure, capable, and modern software to run your computer that rivals all others in popularity and actual use, you will want to try the
      <ulink url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</ulink>
      operating system. Perhaps you've been using a member of the Unix/Linux family - Linux, Android, ChromeOS, BSD, Azure Sphere, or even macOS - for quite a while. If so, you are likely looking for new ways to optimize your technology for the way you work.
    </simpara>
    <simpara>You've likely switched to Linux to be able to use software that is like your previous computer's software, only better. By "better" you probably mean: a modern but familiar user experience, easy to understand and use, designed with security built-in, and with protection from viruses and spyware included. You want all of that included and upgradeable at no additional charge. You want it all to "just work" with minimal or no maintenance -- automatic security updates and software upgrades for both the operating system and all of your installed applications. You don't mind paying for software, but you prefer the "try before you buy" philosophy. Ubuntu MATE gives you all of that and more!</simpara>
    <simpara>While it is great for users who have migrated from Windows, macOS, or ChromeOS, Ubuntu MATE is also an excellent choice for any kind of computer user, from casual home user to professional software developer. That's because of its modern, functionally thought-out design. Ubuntu MATE is capable enough for even the most experienced computer user because, well, it's Linux! It has the power of every other Linux built-in. Simply put, it provides a practical alternative to other software that can run on your computer.
    </simpara>
    <simpara>With that in mind, this guide is written from the perspective that Ubuntu MATE is a typical modern Linux for the average computer user. Let's assume that our fictional "average user" is someone who needs to browse the Internet, check email, use a text editor or word processor, and maybe read and store document files. Let's also include viewing and editing photos, watching videos, and listening to music and podcasts. Whether you are new to Linux, upgrading from Windows, macOS, or ChromeOS to Linux, or just thinking about moving to Linux, this documentation will provide you with practical, day-to-day guidance on how you can use Ubuntu MATE and its applications. This is a guide for new users and a reference for all users of Linux.

      <title>Why Users Switch from Windows</title>
      <simpara>In addition to common and well-founded concerns around security, we often receive questions and comments from Windows users who have become more and more dissatisfied with Microsoft's operating system. It seems that after purchasing and installing a new version, or more likely purchasing a new computer with the upgraded operating system pre-installed, those users are finding that they have to repurchase newer versions of the same software applications they already own, just to have them work with the upgraded version of Windows. Switching to online, cloud-based software applications might at first seem to be a practical alternative, but those applications are often less capable and at least as expensive, especially after a year or more of paying monthly subscription fees. To add insult to injury, Windows users sometimes also have to pay for new accessories like printers and document scanners to replace perfectly functioning older models that require software that is no longer compatible with the 'upgraded' version of the operating system. Because of all this, that promise of a 'free upgrade' from Windows 7 or 8 to Windows 10 has, in fact, turned out to be anything but free. In fact, it can be just as expensive as previous Windows upgrades have been.

    <sect2 id="macos">
      <title>Why Users Switch from macOS</title>
      <simpara>Switching to Apple's macOS doesn't get you off of the treadmill of spending more and more money for software and hardware upgrades. If anything, it accelerates that treadmill. Apple's recent direction with its products seems to continue the trend of ever-more expensive products that eliminate as many of its printer, monitor, keyboard, mouse, and other accessory ports as possible. Expensive dongles and adapters must be moneymakers for Apple. They've also been sealing shut the computer's case on newer models, eliminating the possibility of replacing or upgrading on your own simple things like RAM, hard drives, and broken parts. Purchasing the latest hardware from Apple has resulted in some older software suddenly being incompatible. Although this is not the first time Apple users have experienced this, it is annoying to have to wait for previously functional applications to be updated just so they work again.</simpara>

    <sect2 id="chromeos">
      <title>Why Users Switch from ChromeOS</title>
      <simpara>Google's ChromeOS has seen a surge in usage recently as students look for affordable computers to take classes online. As users acquire inexpensive Chromebooks, many are finding that they are sluggish as compared with more capable PC hardware. They also find that doing everything within the Chrome browser, relying on browser performance-reducing plug-ins, doesn't meet their expectations. Sometimes you just need to run a dedicated application on your computer's operating system to get things done! Google has discontinued support and security updates for the oldest Chromebooks and 
      <ulink url="https://killedbygoogle.com/">they famously kill their apps, software, and hardware offerings</ulink>
       with little notice. As a result, users may wonder how soon they'll lose access to the software and hardware they rely on for their daily computing needs.</simpara>

      <title>Ubuntu MATE Works for You, Not the Other Way Around</title>
      <simpara>Increasingly, the OS developers, Microsoft, Apple, and Google, don't let you upgrade that perfectly-functioning computer hardware you purchased a few years ago, even though it has almost the same specs as the newest computers available today. You are told it 'isn't capable' of running modern software. Insultingly, your Windows computer that is supposedly incapable of running more modern software keeps trying to force you to upgrade to the incompatible version! Perhaps you'd rather learn how to personalize Linux than hunt down one more Windows hack or workaround to prevent your computer from doing things you don't want it to be doing. Maybe you just want to use your computer to get things done. Maybe you believe your computer should be doing work for you, and not the other way around. Ubuntu MATE is designed to make all of that a reality!</simpara>

    </simpara>

      Ubuntu is developed by Canonical, Ltd. and is available in a number of different flavors, each coming with its own desktop environment. Started as a community-developed project, Ubuntu MATE takes the Ubuntu base operating system and adds the

    </blockquote>
    <simpara>
      The MATE Desktop is an example of such a desktop environment. It includes a file manager which can connect you to your local and networked files, a text editor, archive manager, image viewer, document viewer, system monitor, and terminal. All of these are highly customizable and managed via a control center. You can find complete documentation for the MATE Desktop Environment and its applications in the

      What Linux, Ubuntu, and MATE Desktop all have in common is they are Open Source. Open source software is software that can be freely used, changed, and shared (in modified or unmodified form) by anyone. In a nutshell, Ubuntu MATE is free, in the truest sense of the word.
    </simpara>
    <simpara>Although you will find some versions (distributions) of Linux for purchase, the vast majority are provided free of charge, like Ubuntu MATE. Open Source software is licensed in a way that allows anyone to give it away for free, no strings attached. For example, the license gives any member of the user community the freedom to use Linux for any purpose, to distribute, modify, redistribute, or even sell the operating system. If you do modify and then redistribute Linux with your modifications, you are required by the license to submit your modifications for possible inclusion into future versions. There is no guarantee that this will ever happen, but if you have made it better, then your changes just might be included in the next release of Ubuntu MATE.</simpara>
    <simpara>Unlike Windows and macOS, Linux is not created and supported by just one company. It is supported by Intel, Redhat, Linaro, Samsung, IBM, SUSE, Texas Instruments, Google, Canonical, Oracle, AMD, and Microsoft. Over 4,000 developers contributed to Linux over the last 15 years.</simpara>
    <simpara>
      This is how we can continually improve and grow without having to charge our users money. Many of the users of Linux are corporations that use the operating system to run their businesses or include it in their products. Many of these corporations provide fixes and new features for Linux as they use the software for their businesses. In fact, Microsoft now offers Ubuntu on Windows.
       <ulink url="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/">The Windows subsystem for Linux</ulink>
       provides an Ubuntu userspace for Windows developers. The improvements provided by both individual users and organizations like Microsoft are
      <ulink url="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/2017-linux-kernel-report-landing-page/">given back to the Linux distribution</ulink>
      and the software improves as a result.
    </simpara>
    <simpara>Whether you are a home user of Ubuntu MATE, an Ubuntu MATE software or application developer, or an employee of an organization that uses the operating system, you are a member of the Linux and Open Source communities and benefit from the efforts of the developers who contribute to Ubuntu MATE and its related projects, Linux, MATE, and Ubuntu. Members of the community can and do run Linux on almost any hardware, from the prettiest Macbook to the cheapest netbook, from the newest Chromebook to some very old machines designed for Windows, and from the most powerful Internet servers to the smallest smart thermostat.

      <guiicon>lebushey</guiicon>
      . The folder that is actually labeled
      <guiicon>home</guiicon>
      contains the personal Home folders for all users setup on your computer. Normally, there is just one user (you) and so the
      <guiicon>home</guiicon>
      folder contains only your own personal Home folder.
    </simpara>
    <simpara>
      By default, your personal Home folder contains several folders (sub-folders) and any files that you create. Viewed from the
      <application>Caja</application>
      file manager,
      <guiicon>Desktop</guiicon>
      is just another folder in your personal Home folder that can, itself, contain folders and files. When viewing the desktop showing your background wallpaper,
      <guiicon>Desktop</guiicon>
      can display special icons that allow easy access to your personal Home folder,
      <guiicon>Trash</guiicon>
      , and removable media such as CDs, USB flash drives, and (if your computer is old enough) floppy disks. See how to enable these special desktop icons in the section
      <xref linkend="icons-system-icons" />
      .
    </simpara>
    <simpara>
      The
      <application>Caja</application>
      file manager is always running while you are using the MATE desktop environment. To open a new
      <application>Caja</application>
      window, double-click on an icon on the desktop such as
      <guiicon>Home</guiicon>
      or
      <guiicon>Computer</guiicon>
      , or choose the application from the menu at
      <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>Menu</guimenu>
        <guimenuitem>System Tools</guimenuitem>
        <guimenuitem>Caja</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>
      .
    </simpara>
    <simpara>
      The file manager window is a file browser of sorts. Double-clicking the icon for a file opens the file in the
      <application>Caja</application>
      software application that lets you view and/or edit the document. Opening a folder by double-clicking on its icon updates the current file manager window to show the contents of the opened folder. You can also open a folder by right-clicking on that folder, then choosing between
      <guimenuitem>Open</guimenuitem>
      (this is the same as simply double-clicking the folder),
      <guimenuitem>Open in a New Tab</guimenuitem>
      , or
      <guimenuitem>Open in a New Window</guimenuitem>
      .
    </simpara>
    <simpara>In addition to the folder contents, the browser window displays a toolbar with common actions and locations, a location bar that shows the current location in the hierarchy of folders, and a sidebar that can hold different kinds of information.</simpara>

    <simpara>You don't need to know how to use the command line to use today's modern Linux distributions, but understanding the basics can help you simplify some tasks with single-line commands, automate repetitive tasks with simple scripts, and use additional features not available in graphical versions of applications.</simpara>
    <simpara>
      Although the
      <application>MATE Terminal</application>
      can be used to launch graphical applications by simply typing the name of the application and pressing the
      <keycap>Enter</keycap>
      key, you normally use it to run applications that are not designed to be run as graphical applications. These text-based applications, known as command-line programs, can be used to create scripts and other programs, get and install additional software from the software catalog, check the status of your computer's hardware and installed software, and many, many other things. In fact, years before graphical applications were made popular for computing, computer users checked email, communicated with other computers, shared files, photos, and programs, and even browsed early versions of the Internet from terminal applications very similar to the
      <application>MATE Terminal</application>
      .

      <title>Example: Installing Applications Using the Command Line</title>
      <simpara>
        As an example of how to use the command line, let's look at the
        <application>apt</application>
        application. It is a powerful command-line tool which can be used to install new software packages, upgrade existing software packages, update the package list index, and even upgrade the entire Ubuntu MATE system.
      </simpara>
      <note>
        <title>Note</title>
        <simpara>
          For additional information about the
          <application>apt</application>
          application, type the following in a terminal window:
        </simpara>
        <screen>man apt</screen>
      </note>
      <simpara>It's good practice to ensure that you have the latest changes made in the Ubuntu software repositories before installing software. The apt command can be used to update the index of available software packages that are on your computer. To do this, type the following in the terminal window:</simpara>
      <screen>sudo apt update</screen>
      <note>
        <title>Note</title>
        <simpara>When you use "sudo" you are telling Linux that you want to run the command as administrator, so for security purposes, you will be asked for your password the first time you use "sudo" in a terminal session.</simpara>
        <simpara>Also, note that what you type in the terminal is case-sensitive. "Install" is not the same as "install." As far as the terminal is concerned, they are two entirely different words.</simpara>
      </note>
      <simpara>
        Installing software using the apt tool is quite simple, provided you know the name of the application, and provided it is available in the software catalog. For example, to install the audio recording and editing application
        <application>Audacity</application>
        , type the following into a terminal window at the command prompt:
      </simpara>
      <screen>sudo apt install audacity</screen>
      <simpara>
        To uninstall (remove) an application is just as easy. To remove the
        <application>Audacity</application>
        application installed in the previous example, type the following:
      </simpara>
      <screen>sudo apt remove audacity</screen>
      <simpara>Adding the "--purge" option to "apt remove" will remove the package configuration files as well. This may or may not do what you want, so use it with caution. Here's how that looks using our same example:</simpara>
      <screen>sudo apt remove --purge audacity</screen>
      <simpara>Over time, updated versions of packages currently installed on your computer may become available from the package repositories. To use the command line to upgrade the applications on your system, first update the package index:</simpara>
      <screen>sudo apt update</screen>
      <simpara>When that command has finished running, type the following to complete the upgrade:</simpara>
      <screen>sudo apt upgrade</screen>

      <title>Display Your System Info Using The Command Line</title>

        You can also type the "list hardware" command,
        <application>lshw</application>
        , at the command line without any switches or options, but the text file it generates runs on forever and is a little difficult to follow in the terminal. It needs to run as root (administrator), so you'll need to type "sudo" in front of the command. The command listed below runs lshw with the -html option to create an html file. Open it in a browser and you have a nice "web page" with all of your hardware specs.
      </simpara>
      <screen>sudo lshw -html&gt;myhardware.html</screen>
      <simpara>When you run this command, it can detect and report on your touchscreen, if you have one, attached USB storage drives, and even the micro-SD card on a mobile phone if you have one charging on a USB port!</simpara>

        Most drivers for Linux distributions like Ubuntu MATE are already provided as part of the Linux kernel. The kernel is the foundational part of the operating system that makes Linux Linux. While a wide range of hardware is compatible with Ubuntu MATE as a result, your computer hardware may include components and peripherals that require proprietary drivers to function properly. When you were installing Ubuntu MATE, you were asked if you wanted to download and use third-party software. If you ticked the checkbox to do that, clicking the

      <simpara>The open source drivers for some proprietary devices, the ones provided in the kernel, are sometimes reverse-engineered. What that means is that the manufacturers of proprietary devices won't provide the specifications or the details of their own drivers to open source developers because they want to keep their "technology" secret. (Hence the term proprietary.) The developers of reverse-engineered drivers provided in Ubuntu MATE have made their best effort and have tested the functionality thoroughly, but sometimes there are features that could not be reproduced and are not provided in these drivers.</simpara>
      <simpara>
        Sometimes, though, manufacturers of proprietary devices will provide Linux-compatible drivers that they develop themselves. They won't let us know how their drivers work, so they never make it into the kernel, but where these proprietary drivers are available, they sometimes perform better than the reverse-engineered versions. With Ubuntu MATE, many of the proprietary drivers that have been made available are provided in the
        <application>Welcome</application>
        application, or in
        <guimenuitem>Software &amp; Updates</guimenuitem>
        under the
        <guilabel>Additional Drivers</guilabel>

          <guimenuitem>Software &amp; Updates</guimenuitem>
        </menuchoice>
        .) Usually, Ubuntu MATE automatically makes the best choice of open source or proprietary drivers for your hardware when it's installed, but you have the choice of which driver works best for you.

        If you find that Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or other hardware does not work, and the

      <simpara>
        If there is nothing there in
        <guimenuitem>Additional Drivers</guimenuitem>
        to improve the performance of your hardware device, you may find something on the hardware manufacturer's site. You may need to install proprietary manufacturer drivers using the command line if you choose to use them. If you do, be careful to follow the installation instructions carefully, and before you install, make a system backup and understand how to uninstall just in case the proprietary drivers don't work. DO NOT simply search for drivers using drivers.com or other third-party sites. When you use third-party sources, there is no guarantee that you aren't getting something that will inject malware or corrupt your system. If you are unsure, or if you simply can't figure it out, you are better off asking about it in Ubuntu MATE forums and looking for someone else that has some advice or experience. Or you could just settle for the lower performance of the reverse-engineered driver. Of course, if you happen to be an expert in a device that doesn't have drivers in the kernel, the open source community would appreciate you sharing your expertise to help develop high-performance open source drivers for inclusion in the kernel.

      <title>Getting Started: System Specifications</title>
      <simpara>
        When you move to a new operating system, whether it's Windows, macOS or a Linux OS that's new to you, it's sometimes difficult to find what you are looking for -- at first. Take finding a list of your system hardware for example. In classic Windows, if you wanted a graphical display of the specs for your computer, you right-clicked on the
        <guiicon>My Computer</guiicon>
        desktop icon and selected
        <guimenuitem>Properties</guimenuitem>
        . With Windows 10, you click the Windows logo in the taskbar, then select
        <menuchoice>
          <guimenu>Settings</guimenu>
          <guimenuitem>System</guimenuitem>
          <guimenuitem>About</guimenuitem>
        </menuchoice>
        . Neither is likely to be very intuitive if you have only ever used a Mac. On Apple's macOS, you select
        <guimenuitem>About This Mac</guimenuitem>
        from the Apple logo menu to get a dialog box with selections to display at least some of your computer's specifications. Linux, too, has graphical tools to display information about your computer's hardware. Ubuntu MATE provides system specifications in the
        <application>Welcome</application>
        application. From the menu, select
        <menuchoice>
          <guimenu>Menu</guimenu>
          <guimenuitem>Welcome</guimenuitem>
          <guimenuitem>Getting Started</guimenuitem>
          <guimenuitem>System Specifications</guimenuitem>

          This graphical method presents a nice browseable list of information, but with a terminal and a few commands, you can really dig under the hood of your Ubuntu MATE computer's hardware. You can also use the command line to reveal some additional information stored in text files on your hard drive. For a discussion about how to do this, see the topic

      Many of the applications you would expect to find installed on a modern computer are provided, pre-installed on Ubuntu MATE. If you don't find an installed application to do what you want to do, you'll likely find it in the
      <application>Software Boutique</application>
      or by using one of Ubuntu MATE's other software management applications, then you can install it from there. See the topic
      <xref linkend="applications-software" />
      for more information about installing software.
    </simpara>
    <simpara>Unlike with Windows and macOS, Ubuntu MATE provides you with all of the pre-installed applications at no charge. And the vast majority of the software available in the software repositories is also free of charge. Here is a sampling of some of the productivity applications you'll find as soon as you start using Ubuntu MATE.</simpara>

        Web-based email programs that come from your Internet service provider (ISP) and Internet mail systems like
        <application>Yahoo Mail</application>
        and Google's
        <application>Gmail</application>
        are convenient to use because they allow you to read and send email from any device. The only thing you need to run these is a web browser and an Internet connection. Many ISPs provide email clients that you can use to read and respond to your email off-line as well. Unfortunately, those off-line programs are usually applications for Windows. Many ISPs also give you the option of using their online email in conjunction with almost any computer-based email client that can handle POP mail or IMAP mail.

      Ubuntu MATE, and other distributions of the Linux operating system are more secure, and better supported than the operating systems pre-installed on most home computer hardware today. Linux is backed by many large corporations, as well as independent developers and users, many of whom are focused on ensuring and improving the security that is built into the operating system. The built-in updater provided with Ubuntu MATE provides security updates for both its software applications and the operating system. Vulnerabilities are patched more quickly and are delivered automatically and more frequently than the two most popular desktop operating systems.
    </simpara>
    <simpara>Unlike operating systems that update only once a month, Ubuntu MATE receives updates continuously. The updates include security patches for Ubuntu MATE and its installed applications and are all provided on the same frequent schedule. This ensures that you have the latest protection for all of your computer's software -- as soon as it's available!</simpara>
    <simpara>Ubuntu MATE is designed to make it difficult for viruses, rootkits, and other malware to be installed and run without conscious intervention by you, the user. Ubuntu MATE users are not administrators by default. Administrators ("root" users) on any computer system have permission to do anything they want, including doing damage to the system. To be extra secure, Ubuntu MATE requires you to provide your administrator password to install or run programs as root. Every single time.</simpara>

Reinstalling an operating system again after something goes horribly wrong is annoying at best, but losing your photographs, emails, and personal documents can be a devastating loss of priceless, irreplaceable valuables. Backing up the information on your hard drive on a regular basis is critical for anyone who uses a computer routinely. You have spent hours on end producing the information that is on your hard drive. You should routinely back up at least your new data files on a weekly basis. "Data" files include databases, documents, spreadsheets, etc. Anything YOU created, imported, or downloaded onto your hard drive is a data file.

      <title>How Do I Know What &amp; Where To Backup?</title>
      <simpara>Years ago, the only realistic way to perform a backup on a home computer was to save the data onto CDs, DVDs, Zip Drives, Jaz Drives or (worse still) floppy disks! Today, your best option is to use online storage or an external hard drive. The focus of this topic is on making backups to hardware devices. If you don't have a network attached storage (NAS) drive on your home network, you can readily purchase an external drive with multiple terabytes (TB) of storage capacity, or even an inexpensive portable USB external drive with a terabyte or more of storage -- large enough to hold the data from most computers' hard drives today.</simpara>
      <simpara>
        On a typical recordable CD, you can store up to 700 megabytes (MB) of information while DVDs can store up to 8.4 gigabytes (GB). Blu-ray discs are a more recent type of optical media. They can hold up to 50GB of data. With the size of files these days, you might get one or two video files on a DVD. If you have a file that is larger than 700MB, like a moderate
        <application>LibreOffice Impress</application>
        presentation file, or a
        <application>Writer</application>
        document with graphics, an ordinary CD has no hope of holding even one whole file.
      </simpara>
      <simpara>When backing-up data files, it is not always necessary to backup every file you have on your hard drive, although it's a good idea to do so monthly. On your Ubuntu MATE computer, few files, if any, outside of your "home" folder need to be backed-up at all. If a disaster were to happen, and you lost your computer or your hard drive, you could simply reinstall the Ubuntu MATE operating system and your applications in well under an hour, then restore the backed-up contents of your "home" folder. Your "home" folder contains the information that you have created yourself, including your mail file, and the settings and preferences for most of your applications.</simpara>

        Large external hard drives have become so inexpensive that it is wise to include an external hard drive in your budget when you are buying a new computer. Ubuntu MATE's
        <application>Caja</application>
        file manager is shown in the illustration above, copying the "home" folder to an external storage device.
      </simpara>
      <simpara>Instead of being stored on your computer's hard drive, the files you copy to an external or networked drive are stored safely off of your computer. That way, if something happens to your computer's internal hard drive, or if you have your laptop stolen, all your files are safely stored on an external device.</simpara>
      <simpara>
        An alternative to a physical drive is an online (off-site) storage service like
        <application>Dropbox</application>
        ,
        <application>Box</application>
        ,
        <application>Google Drive</application>
        , or
        <application>SpiderOak</application>
        . The advantage to this kind of backup is that your files are stored on the Internet. Even if the worst were to happen, and you lost everything to a fire or flood, your backups would be safe. And if you copy your files to online storage, you will also likely be able to access them from another computer, a tablet or smartphone!

    <sect2 id="security-insurance">
      <title>Backing up Your Computer Is Cheap Disaster Recovery Insurance</title>
      <simpara>One way to backup inexpensively is to get a large USB external hard drive and copy everything in your "home" folder to it on a regular basis. And perhaps the easiest way to ensure that you make your backups regularly is to automate the process using the backup software that comes pre-installed with Ubuntu MATE.

        At least monthly, you should make a complete backup of everything important on your hard drive either by using backup software or by simply copying to a second hard drive or a network drive. Linux applications such as the pre-installed Ubuntu MATE
        <application>Backup</application>
        (
        <application>Déjà Dup</application>
        ) application can automate these backups for you. You do this so that if your computer or hard drive were to be stolen, destroyed or damaged beyond repair, you would have a "disaster recovery" copy. From a "disaster recovery" copy, you could restore your entire "home" folder to the condition it was in, at the time of your last backup. If you do such a complete backup monthly, the worst case would be that you would have to restore less than a month's worth of additional data from your incremental data backups. (Incremental backups contain only what has changed since your last full backup.)

      <simpara>In reality, how often you should backup depends on several factors. In general, the more you use your computer or the more critical the work you are doing, the more often you should backup.</simpara>
      <simpara>
        As a general guideline, you should use the external drive and/or your online storage to make a complete backup of your entire hard drive every month. So that you don't forget, automate the process using the backup software pre-installed with Ubuntu MATE. You can even set up the
        <application>Backup</application>
        application so that it copies only new files, and updates new versions of files on your computer to the backup device, never deleting anything from the copy. What a lifesaver that can be!
      </simpara>
      <simpara>Use an online service or external hard drive to make a monthly full backup. In addition, each week you should back up your critical data files in an incremental backup onto your external storage, or to your online storage. Incremental backups can be automated, too.</simpara>

      Accessibility, also referenced as "Assistive Technology" or "Universal Access," is a key priority for Ubuntu MATE. When computer access is shared within a household or business and where individual needs differ, Ubuntu MATE is an excellent solution.

From there you can check the box to enable assistive applications, change which visual and mobility applications are used by default, and even change whether they are started when your computer starts up. You can also modify your keyboard (sticky keys, slow keys, bounce keys) and mouse (locate pointer, acceleration, sensitivity, drag &amp; drop, double-click timeout) accessibility settings from here. You can even enable an on-screen keyboard if you need it.

      Ubuntu MATE has many keyboard shortcuts that, by pressing a combination of keys, help you do things that normally require a mouse, trackpad, or another input device that might also require sight or muscular range of motion not possible for some computer users requiring accessibility. For some of these keyboard shortcuts, Ubuntu MATE makes use of a special meta key, the "Super" key, available on most computer keyboards. The Super key can be used to activate the menus/launchers and many keyboard shortcuts that include the Super key. Note that on computer keyboards designed for use with the Windows operating system, the Super key is labeled with the "Windows" logo. On keyboards designed for use with Apple's operating system, the Super key is labeled as the "Command" key. On computers designed for Linux, the Super key may be labeled with the Tux penguin logo (the Linux mascot), the Ubuntu logo, or perhaps even a blank square. For additional information about keyboard shortcuts and enabling the Super key on some computer hardware, see the section:

      <simpara>
        If you want to use these features at the login screen, before Ubuntu MATE even starts, the accessibility icon in the upper right of the screen lets you toggle on and off
        <application>Orca</application>
        and
        <application>Onboard</application>

        screen reader is a free, open source, flexible, and extensible screen reader that provides you with access to the graphical desktop via user-customizable combinations of speech and/or braille.

        The

        documentation on the website occasionally refers to the "Orca Modifier" key. The key that

        You may find that the screen reader speaks too slowly or too quickly for you. You can adjust the rate at which
        <application>Orca</application>
        speaks, and make other adjustments as well, in Orca Preferences. To get to the Orca Preferences screens, press

        <keycap>Spacebar</keycap>

        <application>Orca</application>
        uses, you will want to refer to the documentation on key bindings on this web page:

      Almost every software package that is available and tested for Ubuntu MATE is available in the online software repositories (software catalog). The concept of software repositories is likely not all that familiar to long-time users switching from Windows since classic Windows users normally had to go to a brick and mortar store or go online to purchase new software for the Microsoft operating system. For macOS users, however, the concept of the Apple App Store is similar in concept to the software repositories. Both contain trusted applications verified to run on their respective operating systems. Unlike most software in the App Store, the vast majority of Linux applications are neither proprietary nor expensive.
    </simpara>
    <simpara>The software repositories for Ubuntu MATE are managed, maintained and updated by the distribution's maintainers and are variably referred to as "the software catalog," "the software library," "the software center," "software sources," or simply "software repositories." These repositories contain almost ALL of the full-featured, free and open source software that has been tested for installation on Ubuntu MATE and other Ubuntu derivatives. And they won't put spyware and viruses on your computer!</simpara>
    <simpara>
      To install software on Ubuntu MATE, you normally use the
      <application>Software Boutique</application>
      . You can also use the
      <application>Software Center</application>
      or the
      <application>Synaptic</application> control-center
      package manager. When a Linux user says "package" think "software package". Software centers and package managers are examples of applications that are used to browse and retrieve software packages from software repositories. Ubuntu MATE conveniently gives you the option to install one when your search in the
      <application>Software Boutique</application>
      returns no results.
    </simpara>
    <sect2 id="software-trusted">
      <title>Trusted Sources</title>
      <simpara>The Ubuntu software repositories include thousands of applications in hundreds of categories, suitable for just about any professional or recreational pursuit, and most are free of charge. When you use Ubuntu MATE, those applications, as well as security updates, driver updates, application updates, software upgrades and operating system upgrades, are all available from trusted sources so you won't need to search the Internet for software. No more risking malware, junkware, or ransomware as a result of downloading from the wrong site! Ubuntu's software catalog is the ultimate in a trusted source!</simpara>
      <simpara>
        There are several ways to obtain software from the software catalog. Ubuntu MATE's own
        <application>Software Boutique</application>
        is a carefully curated selection of the best-in-class applications from the Ubuntu repositories, chosen because they integrate well, complement Ubuntu MATE and enable you to personalize your computing experience. When you first install Ubuntu MATE, the
        <application>Software Boutique</application>
        is the main graphical application you will use to install software. Other applications are also available to explore the complete Ubuntu software catalog. You have full access to the entire library at any time using the command line, but in order to obtain software from the complete software catalog using a graphical application that lets you browse through it, you will need to enable one or more of the software center applications from within the
        <application>Software Boutique</application>
        .

      Although you can do some basic tweaking out of the box with other operating systems, Linux is infinitely more configurable than Mac or Windows. Sure you can get add-on software to personalize your Windows desktop quite a bit, but Ubuntu MATE provides the customization tools built right in, with additional utilities just a few clicks away in the software repositories (free software store). What makes Ubuntu MATE so much more flexible is that it is designed to be customizable.
    </simpara>
    <simpara>So, what can you do with Ubuntu MATE? From simply changing the background desktop image (wallpaper) to altering the menu position, to making your desktop a virtual "dashboard" for displaying the health and performance of your computer's hardware, Ubuntu MATE can do it. You can even revamp the Ubuntu MATE desktop to make it look and behave convincingly like macOS or Windows. Covering all of the possibilities for customization would fill an entire book, so this section will simply give you some ideas as to what can be done, and it will be up to you to explore on your own how you can configure your system to make it look and work the way that best suits your style.</simpara>

      and can be used to quickly change how things look and feel. You can even make Ubuntu MATE look and work like other popular operating systems if that's what you want. Or you can give it a unique and distinctive look of its own so that anyone looking at your screen can tell you aren't using the same computer software they are!

        Of course, since this is Linux, with any of these eight layouts, you can move the panels to the sides of your screen if you like, you can add or remove a dock, and you can even name and save your own customized panel layouts to make it easy to switch between them. All of this is done from
        <application>MATE Tweak</application>
        . Using the
        <application>MATE Tweak</application>
        application, you also can control the size of the icons that appear in the panels, which icons display on your desktop, and whether the windows show some animation or snap into position when they open. You can even change whether the window controls for Close, Minimize and Maximize appear on the left, like macOS, or on the right, like Windows.

      <title>Familiar (Ubuntu-MATE) Layout</title>

        When you first install Ubuntu MATE, you'll be using its own layout, named Familiar. The Familiar layout, introduced in release 18.04, is based on the Traditional layout with the menu-bar (Applications, Places, System) replaced by the Brisk menu's simple "
        <guimenu>Menu</guimenu>
        ". The Familiar layout has a clock in the top right, and a panel with the list of open applications at the bottom. The menu for each application appears at the top of the application's window in the familiar way -- that is 'familiar' if you are used to the way it's done on Microsoft's windows. If you prefer to try something else, you can select a different panel layout using the
        <application>MATE Tweak</application>
        "Panel" options.

      <simpara>If you have tried other Ubuntu flavors and you like the look of the Unity desktop, you'll find the Mutiny layout familiar. It mimics, as closely as possible, the Unity 7 interface used in traditional Ubuntu through 2017. Mutiny has a dock of icons on the left of the screen to launch applications, show pinned applications, and show running applications. A unique feature of the Mutiny Layout is the menu icon at the top of the dock which displays a full-screen pane of application icons listed in categories. Each application's menu appears at the top of that application's window.

        Another quick way to adjust the look of your Ubuntu MATE desktop is to change the location of the window controls. You know, the buttons you use to minimize, maximize, and close a window. Ubuntu MATE let's you put them on the left like on macOS or on the right like Windows. You can also include or exclude a button for a menu with more window options. You may notice that the screen shots included in this guide have a mix of button locations. Choose the location that you like best or switch between them as your mood changes.

        A desktop theme can include the set of fonts and colors used on your desktop, the size and style of icons, the size, shape and color of the borders of each window, whether there are 3-D or animation effects, and even whether the buttons have icons. Changing your theme is just as easy as changing background wallpaper.

        The bars at the top and bottom edges of Ubuntu MATE's Traditional Layout are called Panels. Apple's macOS has a menu panel at the top edge of the screen. The icons that are typically at the bottom of a macOS desktop are actually in a dock and not truly in a panel. The single panel in Windows is known as the "taskbar" and is typically located at the bottom edge of the screen. The top and bottom panels of Ubuntu MATE can be easily modified in many ways and moved into a different position on the screen. You can also have more or fewer than two panels if you wish.

        If you want to create System icons for such things as your "Computer," your "Home" folder, the "Trash" icon, an icon to access locations on your "Network," or "Mounted Volumes" like USB drives and DVD drives, then Ubuntu MATE makes that easy for you, too. You simply use the
        <application>MATE Tweak</application>
        application, located in
        <application>Control Center</application>
        to select the icons you want to be displayed. The screenshot below shows your "Desktop" options. Ensure that the
        <guilabel>Show Desktop Icons</guilabel>

      <title>Editing the Icons in the Menu</title>
      <simpara>Ubuntu MATE provides you with the ability to edit the main menu in the top panel. This can be very helpful if, for example, you have created a bash script that you want to launch from the menu like any other application. You can even give it a custom icon.</simpara>
      <simpara>
        <emphasis>Launching a Script:</emphasis>
      </simpara>
      <simpara>
        In this example, you'll see how a custom icon can be added to run a script that toggles on and off 100% screen brightness and a sleep delay. Remember, this is just one example of how you can add something to the menus. You can add a menu item for a script like this, you can add a menu item for an application, or you can add a menu item to open a specific document in a word processor or other application. It's up to you. To illustrate, the screenshot below shows the "toggle-awake.sh" script open for editing in the
        <application>Pluma</application>
        text editor application. The
        <application>Pluma</application>
        theme has been switched to a brighter one using its
        <guimenuitem>Preferences</guimenuitem>
        settings to make the text easier to read here.

        <ulink url="https://ubuntu-mate.community/t/workarounds-for-apps-that-dont-support-hidpi">still being perfected</ulink>
        . However, with the 18.04 release, the Ubuntu MATE team has released a utility that automatically detects your 4K display and sets the appropriate screen scaling for you. Without scaling, you may find that 4K displays, like screens on such modern laptops as the Dell XPS 13, or external 4K monitors have tiny icons and fonts that make them difficult to see and to use. With HiDPI support, Ubuntu MATE lets you take advantage of the full resolution of your beautiful 4K display and still have everything readable.

        Today you can install Linux on almost any computer hardware -- Mac or Windows PC. With a computer like one from designed-for-Linux lines such as System76, Entroware, OpenSourcePC, or Dell XPS Developer Edition, you can be sure you'll have the "just works" experience with whatever version of Linux you choose to install. But whether you choose a computer with Linux pre-installed, or you install it on hardware you already own, out-of-the-box laptop battery life can sometimes be disappointing. Here are some things you can do to improve your laptop's longevity when you don't have a connection to AC power.

      <title>2. Adjust screen brightness</title>
      <simpara>
        A laptop's biggest battery usage is typically in powering the LCD screen. The brighter the screen, the more power is consumed. On some models, reducing backlight brightness from 100% to about 50% or even 30% provides enough illumination to see the screen comfortably except when outdoors, and dramatically improves battery life. That adjustment is usually controlled by hardware keys on your keyboard. If you can find a brightness setting that allows you to easily read the screen, but no brighter, then you'll extend your on-battery time for sure. You'll find the software-based brightness adjustment on the
        <guilabel>On AC Power</guilabel>
        tab. Its setting applies to both when you are on AC (mains) power and when you are on battery. However, if you also choose
        <guilabel>Reduce backlight brightness</guilabel>
        on the
        <guilabel>On Battery Power</guilabel>
        tab, then when using battery power, your display is actually adjusted to 50% of the display brightness you choose.

They don't develop a "memory" when you "top them up" like they used to, but they do have a limited number of full charge cycles they can handle before they expire. If your laptop's battery will no longer hold a charge, maybe it's time to replace it. Hopefully, your model allows you to do that.

        The concept of a screensaver was important in the days when the cathode ray tube (CRT) was the only type of computer monitor available. In today's world, this software that originally prevented a permanent image from burning into your CRT screen is used mainly to provide an interesting animated image on the monitor when you step away. Although the power management settings can lock your screen, so too can the screensaver. It's your choice whether to use the screensaver or the power management settings to manage screen locking. If you don't care for an animated screensaver, you can choose to disable it altogether.

      Ubuntu MATE is designed to run on almost any computer hardware. Of course, Ubuntu MATE runs particularly well on the newest, fastest hardware, but it also runs well on almost any vintage of machine. In fact, an older computer designed during the Windows Vista era can easily be outfitted with the new, modern and fully-supported Ubuntu MATE and it will likely run better than it did with the previously installed operating system. Of course, Ubuntu MATE will run much more efficiently if your computer meets or surpasses the recommended requirements. These are the recommendations for Desktop and Laptop computers.

      The Ubuntu MATE website's
      <ulink url="https://ubuntu-mate.org/download/">download page</ulink>
      gives you several options for downloading an ".iso image file" that you can use to create a CD, DVD or USB drive that allows you to try Ubuntu MATE without changing your computer at all, with an option to install it permanently later. You will need at least 512MB of RAM to install from this image.

        The .iso file you downloaded using the instructions in the previous topic doesn't do you much good on its own. You need to put that file in a form that will allow you to install it on your computer. This section describes how to create the installation media (CD, DVD, SD card, or USB drive) that will allow you to do just that. As a note, installable media is often referred to as "bootable" or "live" media because using this method you run Ubuntu MATE directly from the media, live. This allows you to try Ubuntu MATE on your computer without installing, and without changing
        <emphasis>anything at all</emphasis>
        on your computer. When you shut down and remove the "bootable" media, your computer is back to normal.
      </simpara>
      <simpara>
        To install and try Ubuntu MATE from a USB drive or SD card, you’ll need media with at least 4 GB of memory and have downloaded a <ulink url="https://ubuntu-mate.org/faq/downloads/">compatible copy of Ubuntu MATE</ulink> for your system. You can also use a CD or DVD to install Ubuntu MATE, but this method is recommended only for older computers or where the computer can't be configured to boot from a USB device. For information on how to make a CD or DVD for installation using Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu, see the "
        <ulink url="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto#Burning_the_ISO_on_to_a_DVD">Burning ISO HowTo</ulink>

        Most likely, if you are considering a switch to Ubuntu MATE, you are using Windows. If you are creating the bootable media from Windows, macOS, or a distribution of Linux, the post "
        <ulink url="https://ubuntu-mate.org/faq/usb-image/">Imaging a USB Drive</ulink>

      <title>Preparing For Installation</title>
      <simpara>Ubuntu MATE is relatively simple to set up, whether you're looking to replace your existing operating system or install Ubuntu MATE alongside an existing one - such as Microsoft Windows or another GNU/Linux distribution.</simpara>
      <simpara>
        Step one:
        <emphasis>Backup!</emphasis>
      </simpara>
      <simpara>
        Back up any important data to another storage device before you start to install in case something goes horribly wrong! Save all of your important files and folders to an external USB drive or a 2nd hard drive. DO NOT save anything to the same drive you intend to use for Ubuntu MATE. Once you start, there is no going back! Here is an article with some considerations around backups:
        <ulink url="http://goinglinux.com/articles/Backups.html">Backup Strategies For Your Computer</ulink>
      </simpara>
      <simpara>
        Step two:
        <emphasis>Plan for recovery</emphasis>
      </simpara>
      <simpara>If you have a recovery partition and your current system allows you to create recovery disks for your computer, stop reading and go do that now. If you decide that Ubuntu MATE is not for you, this will allow you to reinstall your original operating system. Then you can use the data backup you made in step one to restore all your data.</simpara>
      <simpara>
        Step three:
        <emphasis>Decide what to do with the recovery partition.</emphasis>
      </simpara>
      <simpara>If your computer has a recovery partition, if you format over the recovery partition, you will not be able to recover your previous operating system. Only format or remove the recovery partition if you are certain that you don't want it anymore.</simpara>
    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="installing-installing">
      <title>Installing</title>
      <simpara>Now that you've created the installation media, you've done your backup, and you've planned for recovery (you DID do all that right?) you are ready to install (or just try) Ubuntu MATE. For most relatively modern computer, the installation process will take well under an hour to complete. Stay connected to the Internet to install all available updates. Plug your device into a power source if it is running on battery power.</simpara>

      Ubuntu MATE has many keyboard shortcuts that, by pressing a combination of keys, help you do things that normally require a mouse, trackpad, or another input device. You can find more keyboard shortcuts documented in the Getting Started section of 
        <application>Ubuntu MATE Welcome</application>
        . This provides a comparison of some of these keyboard shortcuts with those you might have used in your previous operating system.

        Changing your theme or window manager in the

        tool might change some of these shortcuts. These changes in behavior are indicated in the descriptions and tables that follow.
      </simpara>
    </note>
    <simpara>Every major operating system makes use of a special hardware "meta key" on the keyboard. They are listed below, and for the purpose of running Ubuntu MATE on your computer hardware, the keys are equivalent with one another. In Linux documentation, the "meta key" is often referred to as the "Super key".</simpara>

      Your keyboard's meta key can be used by Ubuntu MATE to activate menus and launchers as well as the many keyboard shortcuts that include the "Super" key. The MATE Dock Applet, used in the Mutiny layout, includes the ability to launch or switch to docked items based on their position in the dock using
      <keycap>Super</keycap>
      +
      <keycap>1</keycap>
      ,
      <keycap>Super</keycap>
      +
      <keycap>2</keycap>
      , and so on. This will be familiar to users switching to Ubuntu MATE from Ubuntu's Unity 7 Desktop. As they are for users of the MATE Desktop in other Linux distributions, both the
      <keycap>Super</keycap>
      +
      <keycap>L</keycap>
      and the
      <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
      +
      <keycap>Alt</keycap>
      +
      <keycap>L</keycap>
      key combinations are recognized as screen lock keyboard shortcuts in Ubuntu MATE.

      <title>Do you need to enable the Super key?</title>
      <simpara>
        The Super key just works after you install Ubuntu MATE on most computer hardware. However, when you order a computer pre-installed with Linux from the manufacturer Dell, you will need to follow Dell's instructions on how to enable the Super key. Details are available from Dell's support website in a knowledge base article entitled, "
        <emphasis>
          <ulink url="http://www.dell.com/support/article/us/en/19/how12108/how-to-enable-the-ubuntu-super-key-on-dell-oem-ubuntu-installations?lang=en">How to enable the Ubuntu super key on Dell OEM Ubuntu installations</ulink>

        <emphasis>abc</emphasis>
        application?
      </title>
      <simpara>In general, the default application selection follows what shipped in previous versions of Ubuntu. The only reason we deviate from the default Ubuntu applications is if they are not compatible with Ubuntu MATE or pull in lots of unnecessary dependencies.</simpara>
      <simpara>The reason for using the default applications as shipped by Ubuntu is the Ubuntu staff support the default applications. The Ubuntu MATE team is rather small so sharing the support responsibility makes sense, both for us and our users.</simpara>

    <sect2 id="faq-mypc">
      <title>Will Ubuntu MATE run on my computer?</title>
      <simpara>If you have a computer from Entroware, System 76, ZaReason or Think Penguin then Ubuntu MATE will absolutely run on your computer. Computers from major vendors such as Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, and Lenovo will most likely run Ubuntu MATE just fine too.</simpara>
      <simpara>Ubuntu MATE is designed to run on almost any computer hardware. Of course, Ubuntu MATE runs particularly well on the newest, fastest hardware, but it also runs well on almost any vintage of machine. In fact, an older computer designed during the Windows Vista era can easily be outfitted with the new, modern and fully-supported Ubuntu MATE and it will likely run better than it did with the previously installed operating system.</simpara>

    <sect2 id="faq-itunes">
      <title>
        Can I use
        <application>iTunes</application>
        on Ubuntu MATE?
      </title>
      <simpara>
        No. This is one of those programs that is specifically designed by Apple NOT to run on Linux. Although Mac OS X has its roots in the same UNIX philosophy as Linux, OS X is not the same as Linux, and applications written for Apple's operating system do not automatically run on Linux. There are, however, plenty of alternative media players that will play music, create playlists, sync with mobile devices, and retrieve, manage and play podcasts.
        <application>Rhythmbox</application>
        is provided with Ubuntu MATE and can play any of the music or podcasts in your
        <application>iTunes</application>
        library.
      </simpara>
    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="faq-safe">
      <title>Is Ubuntu MATE secure and safe to use?</title>
      <simpara>Ubuntu MATE is designed with security in mind. Unlike operating systems that update only once a month, Ubuntu MATE receives updates continuously. The updates include security patches for Ubuntu MATE and all of its components. Security updates for all of its installed applications are also provided on the same schedule. This ensures that you have the latest protection for all of your computer's software, as soon as it's available!</simpara>
    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="faq-secure">
      <title>Is Ubuntu MATE more secure than other operating systems?</title>
      <simpara>We think that security on Linux systems like Ubuntu MATE is superior. Ubuntu MATE users are not administrators by default. Administrators ("root" users) on any computer system have permission to do anything they want, including the ability to damage the system.</simpara>
      <simpara>For example, other operating systems look at the name of a file to determine which program should open it, then immediately attempt to open it! That design makes it easy for an intruder to attack a computer. Ubuntu MATE opens a file based on what the file is, not based on its name. So even if a malicious program disguises its identity by using the name "Last Will and Testament.txt" Ubuntu MATE will recognize the file as a program. The system provides a warning that the file is not a text file, but that it is a program that will be run if you give it permission to continue. To be extra secure, Ubuntu MATE requires you to provide your administrator password before that permission is granted. Every single time.</simpara>
    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="faq-virus">
      <title>Can Ubuntu MATE get computer viruses and malware?</title>
      <simpara>Ubuntu MATE can get viruses and other infections… but it doesn't. Rapid and timely updates ensure that there are very few (if any) threats to Linux systems like Ubuntu MATE that persist in the wild. In reality, there have been very few "public" infections in the last 10 years that can affect Ubuntu MATE. They are no longer a threat to anyone installing or using a modern Linux distribution today. Ubuntu MATE is designed to make it difficult for viruses, rootkits, and other malware to be installed and run without conscious intervention by you, the user. Even if you do accidentally invite in an infection, chances are it's designed to attack Windows and won't do much, if any damage to Ubuntu MATE.</simpara>
    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="faq-free">
      <title>How can Ubuntu MATE be free?</title>
      <simpara>What Linux, Ubuntu and MATE Desktop all have in common is they are Open Source. Open Source software is software that can be freely used, changed, and shared (in modified or unmodified form) by anyone. In a nutshell, Ubuntu MATE is free, in the truest sense of the word.</simpara>
      <simpara>Although you will find some versions (distributions) of Linux for purchase, the vast majority are provided free of charge, like Ubuntu MATE. Open Source software is licensed in a way that allows anyone to give it away for free, no strings attached. For example, the license gives any member of the user community the freedom to use Linux for any purpose, to distribute, modify, redistribute, or even sell the operating system. If you do modify and then redistribute Linux with your modifications, you are required by the license to submit your modifications for possible inclusion into future versions. There is no guarantee that this will ever happen, but if you have made it better, then your changes just might be included in the next release of Ubuntu MATE.</simpara>
      <simpara>Many of the users of Linux are corporations that use the operating system to run their businesses or include it in their products. Many of these corporations provide fixes and new features for Linux as they use the software for their businesses. These improvements are given back to the Linux community and Ubuntu MATE improves as a result.</simpara>
      <simpara>This is how we can continually improve and grow without having to charge our users money.</simpara>
